Phishing Email Analysis Task Report

Name: Krushal Hirpara
Date: 21 October 2025

================================================================================

SUMMARY

- Completed hands-on phishing analysis using real-world samples
- Learned to analyze headers, bodies, links, and attachments
- Practiced safe analysis techniques and documented IOCs
- Improved ability to detect and respond to phishing threats

================================================================================

STEP 1: Introduction to Phishing Analysis

What I learned:
Phishing is a cyber attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities to trick users into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Awareness and hands-on analysis are essential to detect and prevent phishing attacks.

================================================================================

STEP 2: Analyzing Phishing Email Samples (TryHackMe Labs)

Platform: TryHackMe
Rooms Completed:
- Phishing Analysis Fundamentals
- Phishing Emails in Action

What I learned:
- How to identify phishing emails by analyzing sender, subject, and content
- Recognizing spoofed sender addresses and urgency tactics
- Spotting brand impersonation and suspicious links/attachments

================================================================================

STEP 3: Email Header Analysis

Tool/Method:
- Viewed email headers (From, To, Subject, Date, Reply-To, Return-Path, X-Originating-IP)

What I learned:
Email headers reveal the true sender, routing path, and possible signs of spoofing. Analyzing headers helps detect forged addresses and suspicious origins.

================================================================================

STEP 4: Email Body and Link Analysis

Tool/Method:
- Examined email body for urgent language, fake branding, and suspicious links
- Used CyberChef to defang URLs and decode base64 data

What I learned:
Phishing emails often use urgent language, fake brands, and links that hide their true destination. Defanging URLs prevents accidental clicks. CyberChef is useful for safe analysis.

================================================================================

STEP 5: Attachment Analysis

Tool/Method:
- Checked for unexpected attachments (PDF, DOT, Excel)
- Used CyberChef for base64 decoding

What I learned:
Phishing emails may include attachments with embedded links or malware. Always analyze attachments in a safe environment and check for hidden threats.

================================================================================

STEP 6: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

What I learned:
IOCs include suspicious sender domains, IP addresses, URLs, and file hashes. Documenting IOCs helps improve detection and response to future phishing attempts.

================================================================================

STEP 7: Key Phishing Techniques Observed

- Spoofed sender addresses
- Use of urgency and social engineering
- Brand impersonation (PayPal, Netflix, Apple, DHL, etc.)
- URL shortening and link manipulation
- Pixel tracking for user activity
- Credential harvesting via fake login pages
- Malicious attachments (PDF, DOT, Excel)

================================================================================

STEP 8: Tools Used

- CyberChef (base64 decoding, defanging)
- TryHackMe platform labs
- (Other tools: VirusTotal, MXToolbox, URLScan.io, as needed)
