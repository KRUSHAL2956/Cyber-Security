# TASK 2:Analyze a phishing Email Sample

I did this task on 21 October 2025. This is my own handwritten-style notes and report from practicing phishing email analysis.

## What’s here
- `report.txt` — my step-by-step notes and findings (what I did and learned)
- `notes.txt` — short theory points I wrote down while learning

## Note
All of this is from my hands-on practice (TryHackMe labs). I kept it simple and in my own words.

Note: `Task 2.pdf` is kept locally and not pushed to GitHub (gitignored).
