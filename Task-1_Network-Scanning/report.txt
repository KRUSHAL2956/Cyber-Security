Network Scanning Task Report

Name: Krushex
Date: 20 October 2025

================================================================================

STEP 1: Installing Nmap

Command:
sudo apt install nmap

What I learned:
Nmap is a network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services. First step
is to install it before scanning.

================================================================================

STEP 2: Check Network Interface

Command:
krushex@KRUSHEX:~/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ ifconfig

Output:
lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 6828  bytes 1638356 (1.6 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 6828  bytes 1638356 (1.6 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

wlp1s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet XXX.XXX.X.XXX  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast XXX.XXX.X.255
        inet6 XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 XXXX::XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 29584  bytes 18089859 (18.0 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 24754  bytes 11080377 (11.0 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

What I learned:
ifconfig shows network interface details. lo is loopback (127.0.0.1). wlp1s0 is
wireless interface with my IP. Shows MAC address, RX/TX packets, and no errors
means healthy connection.

================================================================================

STEP 3: Finding IP Address

Command:
krushex@KRUSHEX:~/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v "127.0.0.1"

Output:
    inet XXX.XXX.X.XXX/24 brd XXX.XXX.X.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp1s0

What I learned:
This shows my IP address and network range. /24 means 256 addresses in the 
network. wlp1s0 is my wireless network interface.

================================================================================

STEP 4: Scanning My Own Machine

Command:
krushex@KRUSHEX:~/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap XXX.XXX.X.XXX
[sudo] password for krushex:

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:31 IST
Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up (0.000015s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.15 seconds

What I learned:
Basic nmap scan checks 1000 common ports. Found port 80 (HTTP) open - means web
server is running. Very low latency because scanning my own machine.

================================================================================

STEP 5: Scanning Gateway Router

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap XXX.XXX.X.X

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:32 IST
Nmap scan report for _gateway (XXX.XXX.X.X)
Host is up (0.0072s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open  domain
MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.49 seconds

What I learned:
Gateway is the router. Port 53 is DNS service which translates domain names to
IPs. MAC address visible because it's on local network. Normal for routers.

================================================================================

STEP 6: Scanning Localhost

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap localhost

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:32 IST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000016s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
631/tcp  open  ipp
3306/tcp open  mysql
5432/tcp open  postgresql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.15 seconds

What I learned:
Localhost scan shows services only accessible locally. Found 4 services:
- Port 80: HTTP (Apache)
- Port 631: IPP (printer service)
- Port 3306: MySQL database
- Port 5432: PostgreSQL database
MySQL and PostgreSQL only on localhost - good for security.

================================================================================

STEP 7: Network-Wide TCP SYN Scan

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -sS XXX.XXX.X.0/24

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:32 IST
Nmap scan report for _gateway (XXX.XXX.X.X)
Host is up (0.0059s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open  domain
MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown)

Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up (0.000016s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 8.49 seconds

What I learned:
-sS is TCP SYN scan (stealth scan). Doesn't complete full TCP handshake so less
detectable. /24 scans all 256 addresses. Found 2 active hosts in 8.49 seconds.
Requires sudo for raw packet creation.

================================================================================

STEP 8: Save Scan Results to File

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -sS -oN scan_results.txt XXX.XXX.X.0/24

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:33 IST
Nmap scan report for _gateway (XXX.XXX.X.X)
Host is up (0.015s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open  domain
MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown)

Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up (0.000016s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 8.45 seconds

What I learned:
-oN saves scan output to text file. Useful for documentation and records.
Created scan_results.txt with complete results.

================================================================================

STEP 9: Service Version Detection

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -sV XXX.XXX.X.XXX

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:34 IST
Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up (0.000015s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.58 ((Ubuntu))

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.59 seconds

What I learned:
-sV detects service versions. Identified Apache httpd 2.4.58 on Ubuntu. Takes
longer (6.59 sec) because it probes the service. Important for finding 
vulnerabilities specific to versions.

================================================================================

STEP 10: Fast Scan

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -F XXX.XXX.X.0/24

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:35 IST
Stats: 0:00:00 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (0 up), 255 undergoing ARP Ping Scan
ARP Ping Scan Timing: About 3.92% done; ETC: 13:35 (0:00:00 remaining)
Nmap scan report for _gateway (XXX.XXX.X.X)
Host is up (0.011s latency).
Not shown: 99 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open  domain
MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown)

Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up (0.000016s latency).
Not shown: 99 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 7.82 seconds

What I learned:
-F scans only top 100 ports instead of 1000. Faster (7.82 sec vs 8.49 sec).
Useful for quick results on common ports only.

================================================================================

STEP 11: Aggressive Scan with OS Detection

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -A XXX.XXX.X.XXX

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:35 IST
Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up (0.000073s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.58 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.58 (Ubuntu)
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.32
OS details: Linux 2.6.32
Network Distance: 0 hops

OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.29 seconds

What I learned:
-A enables aggressive scan with OS detection, version detection, and scripts.
Identified Linux 2.6.X, Apache 2.4.58, and HTTP default page. 0 hops means
scanning same machine. Provides detailed info but more detectable.

================================================================================

STEP 12: UDP Scan

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -sU -p 53,67,68,123 XXX.XXX.X.X

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:35 IST
Nmap scan report for _gateway (XXX.XXX.X.X)
Host is up (0.016s latency).

PORT    STATE         SERVICE
53/udp  open          domain
67/udp  open|filtered dhcps
68/udp  closed        dhcpc
123/udp closed        ntp
MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.57 seconds

What I learned:
-sU scans UDP ports (different from TCP). -p specifies which ports. Found DNS
on 53 and DHCP on 67. "open|filtered" means unsure if open or blocked by 
firewall. UDP scanning slower than TCP.

================================================================================

STEP 13: Ping Scan (Host Discovery)

Command:
root@KRUSHEX:/home/krushex/Desktop/Cyber Security/Task-1_Network-Scanning$ sudo nmap -sn XXX.XXX.X.0/24

Output:
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-20 13:36 IST
Nmap scan report for _gateway (XXX.XXX.X.X)
Host is up (0.0076s latency).
MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown)
Nmap scan report for KRUSHEX (XXX.XXX.X.XXX)
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 8.06 seconds

What I learned:
-sn is ping scan (host discovery) without port scanning. Just finds which hosts
are alive. Faster than full scan. Found 2 out of 256 addresses active. Good
first step before detailed scanning.
