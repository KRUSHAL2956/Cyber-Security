I Summary
=========

This document reports on the results of an automatic security scan.
The report first summarises the results found.
Then, for each host, the report describes every issue found.
Please consider the advice given in each description, in order to rectify
the issue.

All dates are displayed using the timezone "Coordinated Universal Time",
which is abbreviated "UTC".

Vendor security updates are not trusted.

Overrides are off.  Even when a result has an override, this report uses
the actual threat of the result.

Notes are included in the report.Information on overrides is included in the report.

This report might not show details of all issues that were found.
Issues with the threat level "Log" are not shown.
Issues with the threat level "Debug" are not shown.
Issues with the threat level "False Positive" are not shown.
Only results with a minimum QoD of 70 are shown.

This report contains all 2 results selected by the
filtering described above.  Before filtering there were 19 results.

Security Issues for Host 10.63.**.***
-------------------------------------

Issue
-----
NVT:    TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows
  to compute the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 4241107333
Packet 2: 4241108373

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to appl!
y the settings at
  runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Tim!
estamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating co!
mmunication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by
  RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in
  between to the target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If foun!
d, the timestamps
  are reported.

Issue

NVT:    ICMP Timestamp Reply Information Disclosure
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103190
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.1)
Port:   general/icmp

Summary:
The remote host responded to an ICMP timestamp request.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following response / ICMP packet has been received:
- ICMP Type: 14
- ICMP Code: 0

Impact:
This information could theoretically be used to exploit weak
  time-based random number generators in other services.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Various mitigations are possible:
  - Disable the support for ICMP timestamp on the remote host completely
  - Protect the remote host by a firewall, and block ICMP packets passing throug!
h the firewall in
  either direction (either completely or only for untrusted networks)

Vulnerability Insight:
The Timestamp Reply is an ICMP message which replies to a
  Timestamp message. It consists of the originating timestamp sent by the sender!
 of the Timestamp as
  well as a receive timestamp and a transmit timestamp.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Sends an ICMP Timestamp (Type 13) request and checks if a
  Timestamp Reply (Type 14) is received.
