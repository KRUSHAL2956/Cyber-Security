# Task 3: Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS

Hey! This is my Task 3 submission for the Cyber Security course. I used OpenVAS to scan my localhost and find security vulnerabilities.

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?

Vulnerability scanning is an automated security testing technique used to identify weaknesses and security flaws in computer systems, networks, and applications. It works by:

- **Probing systems** for known vulnerabilities using a database of security issues
- **Checking configurations** against security best practices
- **Identifying outdated software** with known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- **Testing for common misconfigurations** that could be exploited by attackers

### Why OpenVAS?

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a powerful open-source vulnerability scanner that:
- Contains a comprehensive database of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)
- Updates regularly with new vulnerability information
- Provides detailed reports with severity ratings (CVSS scores)
- Can scan networks, systems, and applications
- Is free and widely used in professional environments

### How it Works

1. **Feed Synchronization** - Downloads latest vulnerability definitions
2. **Port Scanning** - Identifies open ports and running services
3. **Service Detection** - Determines software versions
4. **Vulnerability Testing** - Tests for known security issues
5. **Report Generation** - Creates detailed findings with remediation advice

## What's in this folder

```
Task-3_Vulnerability_Scan/
├── README.md           <- You're reading this
├── report.txt          <- Full vulnerability report (step-by-step process)
├── notes.txt           <- My detailed technical notes and observations
└── scan_data/          <- All the raw XML files and scan outputs
```

The scan_data folder has all the original XML files from OpenVAS if you want to dig deeper into the technical details.

**Note:** The report.txt file now follows a step-by-step flow showing the entire process from installation to final recommendations.

## Quick Summary

**What I scanned:** My Ubuntu 24.04 machine (IP: 10.63.**.***)  
**When:** October 24, 2025  
**Tool used:** OpenVAS Community Edition v26.1.0  
### What I found:

- **Total findings:** 19 results
  - High severity: 0 ✓
  - Medium severity: 0 ✓
  - Low severity: 2 (identified)
  - Informational: 17 (general information)

- **Open ports:** Just 1 (port 80 running Apache)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 (detected correctly)

### Main Findings:

1. **TCP Timestamps enabled** (Low severity)
   - Reveals how long system has been running
   - Can help attackers figure out patch schedule
   - CVSS Score: 2.6

2. **ICMP Timestamps enabled** (Low severity)  
   - Responds to ping timestamp requests
   - Old vulnerability (CVE-1999-0524)
   - CVSS Score: 2.1

3. **Apache 2.4.58 analysis** (Important discovery)
   - Running Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.58
   - Has 20 known CVEs including 4 CRITICAL ones
   - Latest version is 2.4.62
   - Currently 4 versions behind

## Files Explained

**Main files to read:**

1. **report.txt** - Complete vulnerability assessment report
   - OpenVAS installation and setup
   - Scan configuration and execution
   - Detailed vulnerability findings
   - Apache CVE analysis
   - Risk assessment and remediation plan

2. **notes.txt** - Technical documentation
   - Scan methodology and observations
   - Analysis of all 20 Apache CVEs
   - Lessons learned and challenges

3. **README.md** - This file, quick overview

**Raw data (scan_data folder):**
- **Screenshots:**
  - 01_openvas_scan_results.png - OpenVAS scan results overview
  - 02_vulnerability_details.png - Detailed vulnerability findings
- **Scan outputs:**
  - report-cffadc6b-2df2-4c7d-9e1d-be9ccd0c6b38.txt - Original OpenVAS text output
  - host-64054809-40c0-4a36-9192-4c2d109fc2a7.xml - System information OpenVAS collected
  - cve-CVE-1999-0524.xml - Details about CVE-1999-0524 (ICMP timestamps)
  - cpe-cpe__a_apache_http_server_2.4.58.xml - Apache 2.4.58 CPE data with all 20 CVEs
  - operatingsystem-e5f46e6e-ec4d-4c83-90d7-7bcd3f33e424.xml - OS detection data
  - task-97c59c88-6bda-4fd0-9adc-cf70304057df.xml - Scan task configuration
  - tasks-20251024.xml - All tasks export

## How to view the results

Just open report.txt and notes.txt in any text editor. Everything is in plain text so it's easy to read.

If you want to see the OpenVAS web interface:
1. Make sure Docker is running: `sudo docker ps | grep greenbone`
2. Open browser: http://localhost:9392
3. Login: admin / Admin@*****
4. Go to Scans → Results

## Security Observations

**Positive findings:**
- Only 1 port exposed to network (port 80)
- Everything else properly firewalled
- MySQL, MongoDB, etc bound to localhost only
- No SSH exposure
- No critical vulnerabilities actively exploited
- System is mostly up to date

**Areas of concern:**
- TCP timestamps enabled (information disclosure)
- ICMP timestamps enabled (CVE-1999-0524)
- Apache 2.4.58 has 20 known CVEs (4 critical)
- Apache is 4 versions behind current release

## What I learned

- How to install and configure OpenVAS using Docker
- How to interpret vulnerability scan results
- Understanding CVE numbers and CVSS scores
- The importance of keeping software updated
- Risk assessment and analysis techniques

**Challenges:**
- Feed synchronization wait
- First scan of 127.0.0.1 failed - had to use actual IP
- Results were filtered by default, had to adjust to see all 19
- Understanding what all the XML files mean
